    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>Ground Meat</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Béchamel Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients needed for the lasagna, including lasagna noodles, ground meat, tomato sauce, cheese, and béchamel sauce. 
            Ensure that vegetables and other optional ingredients are washed and chopped.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions.
            In a separate pan, brown the ground meat and season it with desired herbs and spices.
            Begin layering the lasagna in a baking dish: start with a layer of tomato sauce, add a layer of noodles, 
            followed by a layer of meat, a layer of béchamel sauce, and a layer of cheese. Repeat the process until the dish is filled, 
            finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to the specified temperature. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake it 
            in the preheated oven. The foil helps to cook the lasagna evenly and prevents excessive browning.
            After a portion of the baking time, remove the foil to allow the top layer to become golden and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven. This helps the layers set, 
            making it easier to cut and serve. Cut into portions and serve hot. Lasagna pairs well with a side of salad or garlic bread.
        </li>
        <li>Sit back, relax, and enjoy your homemade lasagna! 
            The layers of pasta, sauce, meat, and cheese come together for a delicious and comforting meal.</li>
    </ol>
